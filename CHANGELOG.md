## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The fallback engine now uses `cloudscraper25` 2.7.0 instead of the original `cloudscraper`
  package.
- The public engine name is still `cloudscraper`. Existing settings, request options, and
  `engineUsed` checks do not need to change.
- The primary `curl_cffi` engine has not changed.
- The module still cannot reliably pass interactive Cloudflare challenges such as Turnstile and
  managed challenges.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Added `CloudScraper@cbcloudscraper` for sending GET and POST requests from a ColdBox
  application.
- Added the `curl_cffi` engine. It sends requests with the TLS fingerprint of a real browser.
- Added the `cloudscraper` fallback engine for older Cloudflare JavaScript challenges.
- Added `auto` mode. It tries `curl_cffi` first and then tries `cloudscraper` when needed.
- Added automatic download and storage of the Windows helper program. Application servers do
  not need Python or a local build step.
- Added settings for servers that need a custom helper path or cannot download files from
  GitHub.
- Added an optional cookie cache. It lets later requests reuse Cloudflare clearance cookies and
  other response cookies.
- Added a result struct that is similar to a `cfhttp` result.
- Added request options for the engine, timeout, headers, proxy, redirects, TLS checks, and
  browser fingerprint.
